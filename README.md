# Unhandled Exception in Scala

This repository demonstrates a common Scala programming error: failing to handle all potential exceptions. The `bug.scala` file contains code that throws an `ArithmeticException` if a division by zero occurs. However, it only includes a catch block for that specific exception.  The `bugSolution.scala` file shows how to correctly handle exceptions to avoid crashes.
